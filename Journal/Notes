Notes for JavaFX:

Main Window is called stage. 
On the stage, you can set it to a specific scene to view.
Scenes require a layout (StackPane, VBox, HBox).
Use the layout to add elements onto the Scene it is a part of using getChildren().

It is possible to style each scene using CSS

For animations, use transitions
	IE:
		use to move entities
		TranslateTransition t = new TranslateTransition();
		t.setDuration(Duration.seconds(1));
		t.setNode(b);
		t.setToY(500-b.getHeight());
		t.setToX(500-b.getWidth());
		t.setAutoReverse(true);
		t.setCycleCount(4);
		t.play();
		
		t.setOnFinished(e -> System.out.println("wow"));
		
Notes for game:
going to use circles for enemies, change color and size when below a certain amount of health
each color of tower is going to specialize in 4 different things, but differently
(single target, aoe, dot, cc)
as for events, they will be temporary buffs/debuffs that cost currency to buy

work on ui?
pane for lives, currency
find events to add, cause them to do something
make towers fire???
animations for firing? animations when enemies die/get hit?
change enemy speeds depending on starting hp?
