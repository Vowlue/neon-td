Notes for JavaFX:

Main Window is called stage. 
On the stage, you can set it to a specific scene to view.
Scenes require a layout (StackPane, VBox, HBox).
Use the layout to add elements onto the Scene it is a part of using getChildren().

It is possible to style each scene using CSS

For animations, use transitions
	IE:
		use to move entities
		TranslateTransition t = new TranslateTransition();
		t.setDuration(Duration.seconds(1));
		t.setNode(b);
		t.setToY(500-b.getHeight());
		t.setToX(500-b.getWidth());
		t.setAutoReverse(true);
		t.setCycleCount(4);
		t.play();
		
		t.setOnFinished(e -> System.out.println("wow"));
		
Notes for game:
going to use circles for enemies, change color and size when below a certain amount of health
each color of tower is going to specialize in 4 different things, but differently
(single target, aoe, dot, cc)
as for events, they will be temporary buffs/debuffs that cost currency to buy
find events to add, cause them to do something
towers need range X make towers fire??? make projectiles :o
MAKE NEW TOWER CLASSES PERHAPS ONE TYPE FOR EACH??? single target aoe utitliy
tower upgrades:::
animations for firing? animations when enemies die/get hit?
work on game over;
change -fx-whatever into cs form if possible;

towers:
electric
firey aoe
laser
