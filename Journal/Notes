Notes for JavaFX:

Main Window is called stage. 
On the stage, you can set it to a specific scene to view.
Scenes require a layout (StackPane, VBox, HBox).
Use the layout to add elements onto the Scene it is a part of using getChildren().

It is possible to style each scene using CSS

For animations, use transitions
	IE:
		use to move entities
		TranslateTransition t = new TranslateTransition();
		t.setDuration(Duration.seconds(1));
		t.setNode(b);
		t.setToY(500-b.getHeight());
		t.setToX(500-b.getWidth());
		t.setAutoReverse(true);
		t.setCycleCount(4);
		t.play();
		
		t.setOnFinished(e -> System.out.println("wow"));
		
Notes for game:
going to use circles for enemies, change color and size when below a certain amount of health
as for events, they will be temporary buffs/debuffs that cost currency to buy

find events to add, cause them to do something
maybe give enemies a variety of colors based on rng
towers need range X make towers fire??? make projectiles :o
tower upgrades:::
animations for firing? animations when enemies die/get hit?
work on game over;
add upgrade and property menu for towers when they are clicked
change -fx-whatever into cs form if possible;
make enemies give money when they die and change speed when attacked?

towers:
CHECK electric fires an electric shock that spreads to enemies close to each other 
fire deals damage to the area around it and afflicts burn 
CHECK laser fires repeated instant lasers at the closest enemy 
icy slows down enemies in its radius 
shield when set up will protect a life and will sacrifice itself when life is lost 
CHECK sniper will constantly pick the first target to snipe 
mine repeatedly spawns mines that deal a certain amount of damage in area around it
booster increases fire rate of towers around it
orbital has orbitals around it that damages enemies that pass through
idk another tower that targets first enemy then bounces on the walls a certain number of times? maybe have pierce
