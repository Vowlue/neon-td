Notes for JavaFX:

Main Window is called stage. 
On the stage, you can set it to a specific scene to view.
Scenes require a layout (StackPane, VBox, HBox).
Use the layout to add elements onto the Scene it is a part of using getChildren().

It is possible to style each scene using CSS

For animations, use transitions
	IE:
		use to move entities
		TranslateTransition t = new TranslateTransition();
		t.setDuration(Duration.seconds(1));
		t.setNode(b);
		t.setToY(500-b.getHeight());
		t.setToX(500-b.getWidth());
		t.setAutoReverse(true);
		t.setCycleCount(4);
		t.play();
		
		t.setOnFinished(e -> System.out.println("wow"));
		
Notes for game:
going to use circles for enemies, change color and size when below a certain amount of health
each color of tower is going to specialize in 4 different things, but differently
(single target, aoe, dot, cc)
as for events, they will be temporary buffs/debuffs that cost currency to buy
find events to add, cause them to do something
towers need range X make towers fire??? make projectiles :o
MAKE NEW TOWER CLASSES PERHAPS ONE TYPE FOR EACH??? single target aoe utitliy
tower upgrades:::
animations for firing? animations when enemies die/get hit?
work on game over;
change -fx-whatever into cs form if possible;

towers:
electric aoe fires an electric shock that spreads to enemies close to each other
fire aoe deals damage to the area around it and afflicts burn
laser single fires repeated instant lasers at the closest enemy
icy utlity slows down enemies in its radius
shield tower utility when set up will protect a life and will sacrifice itself when life is lost
sniper single target will constantly pick the first target to snipe
mine tower: repeatedly spawns mines that deal a certain amount of damage in area around it
booster tower: increases fire rate of towers around it
