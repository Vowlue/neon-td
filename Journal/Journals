5/4/17: Today, I plan to learn how to set up a window in JavaFX, from Scenes to Stages. Today, I learned how to use the GridPane and Group layouts to create scenes. Tomorrow, I will try to explore more types of layouts to find one that I may use for my game.
5/5/17: Today, I plan on researching how to use CSS to apply it to my scenes in JavaFX. Today, I learned that it is possible to create custom layouts, so I might make one to use for my project. Apparently, CSS is another file you must add to your project, so I am also planning out the packages I need to organize my project.
5/8/17: Today, I plan on researching what kind of UI elements can be added to the screen in order to set up the game. However, with the limited amount of elements, I may have to customize my own that will fit the task. Also, I am thinking of what UI elements I would like to include in my title screen which will be used to lead the player to the game. Next time, I will try to design the layout of the game.
5/11/17: Today, I plan on building the layout of my game using JavaFX Scene Builder. I think I will have a main menu screen and then an additional options screen that should be selected before the game begins. In addition, there will be a screen for the actual game where there will be turret selection, active selection, and the buying menu where it will be possible to purchase turrets and "actives" as long as you have enough currency.
