5/4/17: Today, I plan to learn how to set up a window in JavaFX, from Scenes to Stages. Today, I learned how to use the GridPane and Group layouts to create scenes. Tomorrow, I will try to explore more types of layouts to find one that I may use for my game.
5/5/17: Today, I plan on researching how to use CSS to apply it to my scenes in JavaFX. Today, I learned that it is possible to create custom layouts, so I might make one to use for my project. Apparently, CSS is another file you must add to your project, so I am also planning out the packages I need to organise my project.
